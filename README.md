# Police-databse-using-Python-and-sql


This project aims to create a police database using Python, SQL, and Jupyter Notebook. The inspiration for this project comes from a Kaggle dataset, which provides valuable data related to law enforcement and crime.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to design and implement a database system that can store and manage relevant information for law enforcement agencies. The database will enable users to perform various operations, such as adding new records, searching for specific data, updating existing information, and generating reports.

Technologies Used
Python: The programming language used for developing the project.
SQL: The language used for creating and querying the database.
Jupyter Notebook: The interactive development environment for running Python code and documenting the project.


Dataset
The project utilizes a Kaggle dataset that contains relevant information for the police database. The dataset includes fields such as incident reports, suspect details, crime types, victim information, and more. The dataset will be imported into an SQLite database for efficient storage and retrieval.


Usage
Open the Jupyter Notebook file .

Run the cells in the notebook to execute the code and interact with the database.

Follow the instructions provided in the notebook to perform various operations on the police database.
